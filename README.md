# CodeWars
This is the GitHub repository where I save copies of the challenges I faced in [codewars.com](https://www.codewars.com/).

## What is CodeWars?
It's a cool website where you face challenges and you get leveled by how good you do. It isn't limited to JavaScript or any or the languages you can find in this repo, it even has Kotlin!

## Don't be a copycat!
If you are going to try to tackle the same challenges, be fair and don't copy. I think they have a copy protection system and you would get catch inmediately, so please, don't even think about it.
